          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            A central challenge in quantum information science is how to scale quantum
            information processing beyond individual devices and to make effective use of
            the resulting large-scale systems. The Center advances theoretical research that
            addresses this challenge by studying quantum networks and distributed quantum
            computation as general, implementation-independent frameworks for scalable
            quantum information processing. We also investigate quantum algorithms and
            protocols that clarify how computational advantages can be systematically
            extracted when quantum computation is extended across multiple, interconnected
            quantum systems. These scaling-oriented studies are complemented by foundational 
            research on quantum control and non-classicality, which underpin all quantum 
            information processing.

          <h2>Quantum Networks: Foundation for Scalable Quantum Information Processing</h2>
          <p>
            As quantum information processing systems grow in size and complexity, scaling 
            beyond individual devices becomes a fundamental challenge. Quantum networks
            provide a general framework in which multiple quantum systems can be
            interconnected and jointly exploited as a larger computational and information-processing resource.
            We investigate the theoretical foundations of quantum networks as an enabling
            structure for scalable quantum information processing, including abstract
            models of quantum interconnects, the capabilities and limitations imposed by
            networked architectures, and the fundamental differences between isolated and
            network-embedded quantum systems.

          <h2>Principles of Distributed Quantum Computation</h2>
          <p>
            This research explores how quantum computation can be performed across multiple,
            physically separated quantum nodes. We study universal principles governing
            distributed quantum operations, including how quantum tasks can be decomposed
            across nodes, how non-local correlations and communication enable joint
            operations, and what fundamental constraints arise when computation is carried
            out in a spatially distributed manner. Through these studies, we aim to clarify
            how the structure of distributed quantum computation differs from that of
            monolithic devices, and how such structures can be systematically exploited to
            extend the reach and functionality of quantum computation.

          <h2>Operational Characterization of Quantum Resources</h2>
          <p>
            We study the operational roles of quantum resources—such as entanglement, quantum
            memory, and quantum and classical communication—in distributed and networked
            settings. Unlike standard entanglement-based frameworks that treat local
            operations and storage as freely available, our work explicitly accounts for the
            costs and limitations associated with memory, communication, and coordination
            across separated systems. The goal is to clarify which resources are required to
            implement quantum operations across distributed systems, how different resources
            can be transformed or combined, and how their availability fundamentally
            constrains achievable tasks.

          <h2>Network-Aware Quantum Algorithms and Protocols</h2>
          <p>
            We study quantum algorithms and protocols that are explicitly designed for
            distributed and networked settings, where computation and communication are
            intertwined. Rather than assuming idealized, monolithic processors, this work
            investigates how quantum tasks can be structured across multiple nodes, how
            non-local operations can be coordinated, and how algorithmic performance is
            affected by the availability and distribution of quantum resources. The goal is
            to identify general principles that govern the effective use of large-scale,
            networked quantum systems.

          <h2>System-Level Evaluation of Quantum Network Components</h2>
          <p>
            This research develops theoretical frameworks for assessing the performance of
            quantum nodes when they operate as components of a larger quantum network. We
            study figures of merit, error models, and performance trade-offs that arise
            specifically in distributed settings, providing principled tools for comparing
            architectures and understanding how local device characteristics impact
            network-level functionality.

          <h2>High-Fidelity Modeling and Simulation of Quantum Systems</h2>
          <p>
            We develop theory-driven modeling and simulation frameworks that aim to capture
            the microscopic dynamics of quantum devices interacting with quantum fields in
            network-relevant settings. A central challenge is achieving sufficient accuracy
            to faithfully represent error mechanisms, correlations, and dynamical effects
            that directly impact large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum information
            processing. To this end, we study efficient methods for simulating high-dimensional
            quantum systems, balancing computational tractability with the level of precision
            required for reliable device modeling and system-level analysis.

          <h2>Quantum Control and Manipulation</h2>
          <p>
            Controlling quantum systems with precision is key to unlocking their
            full potential. Our research explores fundamental quantum control
            tasks to uncover the principles that govern quantum information
            processing. However, real-world implementations are inevitably
            affected by control errors and environmental decoherence. We
            investigate how these imperfections impact our ability to manipulate
            quantum systems and how to mitigate them. Through these efforts, we
            aim to develop more effective control strategies, paving the way for
            more powerful and robust quantum information processing.

          <p>
            Quantum mechanics reveals phenomena that challenge classical
            intuition, showcasing the unique nature of quantum systems. We
            explore the fundamental principles of quantum non-classicality and
            how they manifest in the manipulation of quantum states. By
            deepening our understanding of these principles, we aim to uncover
            new ways to harness quantum mechanics for information processing
            that transcends classical limitations.
