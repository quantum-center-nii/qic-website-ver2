          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            It remains a central challenge in quantum information science to scale quantum
            information processing beyond individual devices and to make effective use of
            the resulting large-scale systems. A core interest of the Center is to address
            this challenge through theoretical work on quantum networks and distributed
            quantum computation. We also investigate quantum algorithms and protocols to
            clarify how computational advantages can be systematically extracted when
            quantum computation is extended across multiple, interconnected quantum
            systems. These scaling-oriented studies are complemented by foundational
            research on quantum control and non-classicality, which underpin all quantum
            information processing.

         <h2>Quantum Networks in Scalable Quantum Information Processing</h2>
         <p>
           To scale quantum information processing in size and complexity, multiple 
           quantum systems must be integrated so as to function collectively as a 
           larger computational resource, forming a quantum network. The resulting 
           system necessarily reflects the complexity of the intended task. 
           Developing a theory of quantum networks therefore requires appropriate 
           abstractions of such structures, together with deep insight into the 
           capabilities and limitations imposed by networked architectures.

          <h2>Principles of Distributed Quantum Computation</h2>
          <p>
            Formulating general principles of information processing in quantum domains
            constitutes a fundamental question, particularly in distributed settings,
            where multipartite systems admit physical descriptions that are irreconcilable
            with classical ones. Progress in distributed quantum computing depends not only
            on advances in our understanding of physical constraints but also on the adoption
            of appropriate conceptual frameworks through which quantum information processing
            tasks are modeled and understood. These frameworks are not fixed a priori, but
            must be shaped and refined against concrete information processing tasks.

          <h2>Operational Characterization of Quantum Resources</h2>
          <p>
            We analyze the operational roles of quantum resources, such as entanglement, quantum
            memory, and quantum and classical communication, in distributed and networked
            scenarios. Unlike the standard entanglement theory that treats local
            operations and storage as freely available, our work explicitly accounts for the
            costs and limitations associated with memory, communication, and coordination
            across separated systems. The goal is to determine which resources are critical to
            implement quantum operations across distributed systems, how different resources
            can be transformed or combined, and how their availability constrains achievable tasks.

          <h2>Network-Aware Quantum Algorithms and Protocols</h2>
          <p>
            We study quantum algorithms and protocols that are explicitly designed for
            distributed configurations, where computation and communication are
            intertwined.
            Rather than assuming monolithic processors, this topic considers   
            how quantum tasks can be structured across multiple nodes and how
            non-local operations can be coordinated.
            The impact on algorithmic performance is inspected with respect to
            the availability and distribution of quantum resources. All in all, these
            contribute to the identification of general principles that govern the 
            effective use of large-scale, networked quantum systems.

          <h2>System-Level Evaluation of Quantum Network Components</h2>
          <p>
            This research constructs theoretical frameworks for assessing the performance of
            quantum nodes when they operate as components of a larger quantum network. We
            propose figures of merit that are tailored for distributed quantum settings, along
            with associated quantum algorithms,
            to enable efficient characterization of individual devices' functionality
            and to facilitate real-time monitoring and operation of large-scale quantum networks.

          <h2>High-Fidelity Modeling and Simulation of Quantum Systems</h2>
          <p>
            We build theory-driven modeling and simulation programs that aim to capture
            the microscopic dynamics of quantum devices interacting with quantum fields in
            network-relevant conditions. A key concern is achieving sufficient accuracy
            to faithfully represent error mechanisms, correlations, and dynamical effects,
            crucial to large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum information
            processing. We devise computational methods for simulating high-dimensional
            quantum systems, balancing overall tractability with the level of precision
            required for reliable device modeling and system-level analysis.

          <h2>Quantum Control and Manipulation</h2>
          <p>
            Controlling quantum systems with precision is indispensable to unlocking their
            full potential. We focus on quantum control
            tasks to uncover the principles that govern quantum information
            processing. However, real-world implementations are inevitably
            affected by control errors and environmental decoherence. We
            examine how these imperfections influence our ability to manipulate
            quantum systems and their mitigation methods. Through these efforts, we
            seek to establish more effective control strategies, paving the way for
            more powerful and robust quantum information processing.

          <p>
            Quantum mechanics reveals phenomena that violate classical
            intuition, showcasing the unique nature of quantum systems. We
            explore such non-classicality and
            its consequences in the manipulation of quantum states to uncover
            new ways to harness quantum mechanics for information processing
            that transcends classical limitations.
